# Travel Bucket List - Solo Project

## Description of my Travel Web App
  
The user accessing the web app should be able to feel welcomed when it first opens it. The main page has an example of how you can incorporate your own ads for travel packages and even make it a part-time blog with travel suggestions. 

The user has access to a dashboard where they can choose whether they can view, add, edit or delete the destinations which they have already visited or which they are yet to visit.
